ROTT Port README
================

This is a port of Apogee's 3D action title Rise of the Triad, originally
released in 1994.  This port duplicates the functionality of the original
game on modern operating systems, including Linux, Win32, and OSX.

This port makes use of the Simple Direct Media Layer, or SDL, and an additional
library named SDL_mixer.  If you do not have these libraries installed, check
the links section below.

This software is distributed in source code format and is licensed under the
terms of the GNU General Public License.  A copy of this license is included
with the software in the file gnu.txt.

This software is not supported by 3D Realms, Apogee, or the porters.

For reference, the primary contributors to this port are:

Steven Fuller
Ryan Gordon
John Hall
Dan Olson

General Hints
-------------

To compile the source code under Linux, change to the rott/ directory and type:

make clean
make

The source code is setup to use shareware binaries.  If you want to use the
registered version of ROTT, edit rott/develop.h and make the following changes:

change
#define SHAREWARE   1
#define SUPERROTT   0
to
#define SHAREWARE   0
#define SUPERROTT   1

After this, save your changes and compile as normal.

If you experience difficulty with sound, you may need to download a CVS version
of SDL_mixer.  Instructions for doing this can be found at the SDL_mixer site,
linked below.
